# flowshop_scheduling_problem
This is an implemention for some algorithms to solve a Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem (PFSP).

## NOTE

Not all algorithms are implemented in this repo, until now, only johnson's algorithm is implemented which only works for a 2 machine problem.


# TODO

1. Implement solution with CDS and NEH heuristics.
2. Make a Branch and Bound solution

# Deployment

`A python virtual environement is strongly advised (Optional)`

1. Install requirements

```bash
pip install flask plotly
```

or Install using __requirements.txt__ file

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Built With

1. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
